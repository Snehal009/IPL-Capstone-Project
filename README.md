## IPL Capstone Project

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes the **Indian Premier League (IPL)** dataset to extract insights, trends, and patterns using **Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Data Visualization tools**. It is designed as a **data analysis & visualization capstone project**, providing hands-on experience with real-world cricket data.

## Project Files

This repository contains two versions of the IPL Capstone Project notebook:

## IPL_Capstone_Project.ipynb
This notebook includes the full code along with all output cells, visualizations, and results. Use this if you want to see the step-by-step execution and output.

## IPL_Capstone_Project_clean.ipynb
This is a clean version of the notebook with only the code (no output cells). Itâ€™s suitable for reviewing or rerunning the code from scratch.

##  Objectives

* Perform **data cleaning** and preprocessing of IPL data.
* Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify hidden insights.
* Visualize **team performance, player statistics, and match trends**.
* Derive meaningful insights that can help teams, analysts, and fans.


##  Key Analysis & Visualizations

* Match outcomes by team and season
* Toss decision impact on results
* Top-performing players (Orange Cap & Purple Cap trends)
* Venue-based statistics
* Win percentage analysis
